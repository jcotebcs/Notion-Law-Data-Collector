2. Click "New integration"
3. Give it a name like "Law Data Collector"
4. Select the workspace where your database will be
5. Copy the "Internal Integration Token" (starts with `secret_`)

### 2. Create a Notion Database

1. Create a new page in Notion
2. Add a database with these properties:
   - **Case Name** (Title) - Main case identifier
   - **Date** (Date) - Case date
   - **Court** (Rich Text) - Court name
   - **Judge** (Rich Text) - Judge name
   - **Case Type** (Select) - Civil, Criminal, Family, Administrative
   - **Status** (Select) - Pending, Active, Closed
   - **Notes** (Rich Text) - Case details

3. Share the database with your integration:
   - Click the "Share" button on your database page
   - Click "Invite" and search for your integration name
   - Give it "Edit" permissions

4. Copy the database ID from the URL (32-character string)

### 3. Use the Application

1. Open your GitHub Pages site
2. Enter your Notion API key (will be saved locally)
3. Enter your database ID
4. Click "Test Connection" to verify
5. Start adding case data!

## Data Fields

- **Local Storage**: API keys stored in browser's local storage
- **Direct API**: Secure HTTPS communication with Notion
- **No Third-Party**: No data passes through external services

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**CORS Errors:**
- This shouldn't occur with modern browsers and HTTPS
- Ensure you're accessing via GitHub Pages, not opening the file directly

**Connection Failed:**
- Verify your API key starts with `secret_`
- Check that your database ID is exactly 32 characters
- Ensure your integration has access to the database

**Database Not Found:**
- Verify the database ID from the URL
- Make sure you've shared the database with your integration
- Check that the integration has "Edit" permissions

### Getting Help

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your Notion integration setup
3. Test your integration using the "Test Connection" button
4. Open an issue on GitHub with details about your problem
