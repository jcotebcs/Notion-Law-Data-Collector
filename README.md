- üîó **Secure Notion Integration**: Server-side API integration eliminates CORS issues
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- üîí **Secure**: API keys managed via environment variables, no client-side exposure
- ‚ö° **Fast**: Serverless architecture with static frontend
- üìä **Recent Cases View**: See your latest entries at a glance
- üöÄ **Easy Deployment**: Deploy to Vercel, Railway, or Render with one click
